# Drupal + React Decoupled ProDev Sprint 

This repo contains the code and instructions for completing our FE ProDev sprint for exploring topics around decouple React and Drupal. Each week will focus on a particular problem or use case around decouple Drupal and React. The goals for each week will be to explore and research the problem for the week and implement a working solution. 

Each week will have its own set of instructions along with a detailed description of the problems we are attempting to solve. There will be links to blog posts and external documentation that may be helpful to explore. There will also be a working solution published to a branch of the this repository.

There are multiple ways to approach this course. For people already familiar with Drupal and React or those who would rather dive head first into a challenge, feel free to ignore the existing solution and use whatever resources you have available. The links in this project README's may be helpful, but also feel free to use any other resources you may find.

For those who are newer to React and/or Drupal and for those who would rather take a more direct approach, there is a working solution available in the project repo in additional to a video walkthrough of the code. Feel free to watch the video first to get an understanding of the solution or work through the problem on your own and come back to solution at the end to compare.

This course is intended to be as flexible as possible and to be approachable to a wide variety of skill sets. Feel free to approach the material how ere you feel best suits your goals and needs.
